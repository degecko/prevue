# Prevue Popup

Chrome Extension allowing users to preview links and images in-page. Get it from the [official Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prevue-popup/afencccmfcofdgnigbenkpplpanigajd).

## Unpacked Loading

If you want to modify the extension, you'll need to load it as an "unpacked extension".

- Clone this repo or download a zip of it and unzip it on your machine
- Go to chrome://extensions in your browser
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Choose the "src" folder and click OK

You might want to disable the official extension while you're using the unpacked version, otherwise they will both work in parallel and will result in strange behavior.
